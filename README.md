# Keras-CNN-CIFAR-10

The CIFAR-10 dataset(Canadian Institute For Advanced Research) is a collection of images that are commonly used to train machine learning and computer vision algorithms. It is one of the most widely used datasets for machine learning research. The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 10 different classes. The 10 different classes represent airplanes, car, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. There are 60,000 in each class. This dataset has 50,000 training images and 10,000 images.
